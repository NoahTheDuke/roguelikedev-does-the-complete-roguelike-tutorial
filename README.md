# THIS PROJECT HAS MOVED

To those who follow it, I've moved this project to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/NoahTheDuke/roguelikedev-tutorial-ecs)!
Please come follow along and fork away there! See below for reasoning.

At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series)!

## Why GitLab?

It's a good question. I have all of my old projects here on GitHub, I've spent my entire programming career on GitHub,
and my cars and computers carry Octocats of all flavors. However, I believe in competition, and I believe in putting my
money and efforts where my mouth leads, so because of a strong stance I've taken personally towards supporting more
open-source companies and efforts I've made in my places of employment for using GitLab, I feel it best to put my new
projects (and my money) there as well.

To be clear, this does not stem from animosity or a desire to spark conflict. I have loved GitHub. I'm just trying
something new.
